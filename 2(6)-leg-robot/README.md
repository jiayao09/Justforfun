EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
</br> 
</br> The purpose of this robot is to develop a mechanism that performs stable movement with a simple control algorithm. Balance for multiple-legged robots always required complex control algorithms as well as significant energy consumption. This robot is designed with a combination of multiple linkage mechanisms for the legs on both sides. With only a few degrees of freedom, the movement of the robot can be simply controlled by one or two motors, and it can walk steadily and surmount obstacles on complex terrain.
</br> </br> 

OPPORTUNITY:
  1. Perform a more stable movement compare to common multilegged robots. 
  2. The robot can be controlled by simple algorithms in order to reduce energy consumption during robot movement.
  3. Ability to change or control movement direction.
</br> 

CURRENT SITUATION:
</br> 
I have designed a two leg system to prof that this mechiansim can be used as a way of movement for robot. And here are two vedio for its movement:

A PDF file for detailed assembly is attached. It includes:
    </br> - BOM
    </br> - Assembly step
</br> IMPORTANT: I have used a 3D printer (Ultimaker (FFF)) for all my parts, which has a tolerance of 0.3mm. Remember to change the hole size for a more precise printer.

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT:
</br> I provided a picture the structure of 6 leg robot below:

Diagram 1: Simple Sketch for 6 Leg Robot 

</br>Compared to the 2-legged robot, the increased structure enables it to make more stable and controllable movements. 
</br>First of all, changing the number of legs not only increases the flexibility of the movement but also distributes the weight of the body onto both sides of the leg. With the new structure, there are always 3 feet (two on one side and one on the other side) on the ground for every movement, which provides a more stable movement with less surface contact. 
</br>Second, I came up with two ideas to control the direction of the robot. One of them is to change the distance for foot 3 (Diagram 1) from the main body. I got the other idea from the structure of the articulated bus and the sketch of the structure is shown above (Diagram 1). Through the modification of the damper length, the direction of the robot can be controlled. It is also possible to make a robot capable of climbing stairs or performing vertical movements by applying the same concept.
